git log --author='NT'


Commit Limiting
       Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may
       be applied.

       Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g. --since=<date1> limits to commits newer than <date1>, and using it with
       --grep=<pattern> further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches <pattern>), unless otherwise noted.

       Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as --reverse.

--author=<pattern>, --committer=<pattern>
           Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
           --author=<pattern>, commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple --committer=<pattern>).
