git log --grep pay
git log --grep pay--stat

--grep=<pattern>
           Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one --grep=<pattern>,
           commits whose message matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but see --all-match).

           When --show-notes is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if it were part of the log message.
